- WEB: Added "Back to top" Overlay button
- CSS: Added Smooth corners to some buttons
- CSS: Moved "Back to top" overlay button to be responsive (hopefully)(CSS Line 303)
- HTML: Changed method to load randomized index text to be "on <body> load". The script tag can finally rest peacefully in <head>
PS. I can't find the font file for overlay button so i'll leave the name here so you might find it and embed it for me "Wingdings 3"
